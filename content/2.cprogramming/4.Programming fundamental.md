# Programming fundamental

## Introduction of computer

A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to specified rules, produces information (output), and stores the information for future use.

Computers consist of two main components: hardware and software.

**Hardware** is the physical parts of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, and central processing unit (CPU).

**Software** is the set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Software includes the operating system, which controls the basic functions of the computer, and application programs, which are used to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, web browsing, and playing games.

Computers are used in a wide variety of settings, including homes, schools, businesses, and government agencies. They are used for a wide range of tasks, including:

- **Communication:** Computers are used to communicate with others through email, social media, and video conferencing.
- **Education:** Computers are used to learn and to access educational resources.
- **Entertainment:** Computers are used to play games, watch movies, and listen to music.
- **Productivity:** Computers are used to create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
- **Research:** Computers are used to collect, analyze, and present data.

Computers have revolutionized the way we live and work. They have made it possible to communicate and collaborate with people all over the world, to access information instantly, and to automate many tasks.

Here are some basic concepts about computers:

- **Input devices:** Input devices are used to enter data into a computer. Common input devices include the keyboard, mouse, and touchpad.
- **Output devices:** Output devices are used to display or print the information that has been processed by the computer. Common output devices include the monitor, printer, and speakers.
- **Central processing unit (CPU):** The CPU is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for processing data and executing instructions.
- **Memory:** Memory is used to store data and instructions temporarily. There are two main types of memory: random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM).
- **Storage:** Storage devices are used to store data permanently. Common storage devices include hard drives, solid-state drives, and optical discs.

Computers are becoming increasingly powerful and sophisticated, and they are being used for new and innovative applications all the time.

## Block diagram and organization

The block diagram of a computer shows the four main components of a computer system and how they interact with each other:

- **Input unit:** The input unit accepts data from external devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, and scanner, and converts it into a form that the computer can understand.
- **Central processing unit (CPU):** The CPU is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for processing data and executing instructions.
- **Memory unit:** The memory unit stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly.
- **Output unit:** The output unit displays or prints the information that has been processed by the computer.

The organization of a computer is based on the von Neumann architecture, which is a conceptual model of how a computer works. The von Neumann architecture consists of five main components:

- **Input:** The input unit accepts data from external devices and converts it into a form that the computer can understand.
- **Storage:** The storage unit stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly.
- **Arithmetic logic unit (ALU):** The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.
- **Control unit:** The control unit controls the flow of data and instructions through the computer.
- **Output:** The output unit displays or prints the information that has been processed by the computer.

## **Number system**

A number system is a way of representing numbers. The most common number system is the decimal system, which uses ten symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Other number systems include:

- Binary system: The binary system uses two symbols: 0 and 1.
- Octal system: The octal system uses eight symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Hexadecimal system: The hexadecimal system uses sixteen symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

## **Binary arithmetic**

Binary arithmetic is the performance of arithmetic operations on binary numbers. The four basic arithmetic operations in binary are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Binary addition**

To add two binary numbers, we start by lining up the numbers vertically by their corresponding place values. Then, we add each column, starting from the rightmost column. If the sum of two digits is less than 2, then we write the sum in the corresponding column and carry over a 0 to the next column. If the sum of two digits is 2 or more, then we write the remainder in the corresponding column and carry over a 1 to the next column.

Here is an example of binary addition:

`1101 + 1010
-------
1111`

**Binary subtraction**

To subtract two binary numbers, we start by lining up the numbers vertically by their corresponding place values. Then, we subtract each column, starting from the rightmost column. If the digit in the minuend (the top number) is less than the digit in the subtrahend (the bottom number), then we borrow a 1 from the next column and add it to the minuend digit. Then, we subtract the two digits and write the result in the corresponding column.

Here is an example of binary subtraction:

`1101 - 1010
-------
0011`

**Binary multiplication**

To multiply two binary numbers, we use the same algorithm as we use for decimal multiplication. We start by multiplying the two numbers together, one digit at a time. We then add up the products of each digit and write the result in the corresponding column.

Here is an example of binary multiplication:

`1101 * 1010
-------
10001
00000
-------
11010`

**Binary division**

To divide two binary numbers, we use the same algorithm as we use for decimal division. We start by dividing the dividend (the top number) by the divisor (the bottom number). We then write the quotient in the corresponding column and multiply the quotient by the divisor. We then subtract the product from the dividend and write the result in the corresponding column. We continue this process until the remainder is 0.

Here is an example of binary division:

`1101 / 1010
-------
10
0000
-------
1101
1010
-------
0001`

Binary arithmetic is the foundation of all digital computer systems. Computers use binary numbers to represent data and instructions. Binary arithmetic is also used in other digital systems, such as calculators and cell phones.

# Processing data

Data processing is the process of converting raw data into meaningful information. It involves a series of steps, including:

1. **Data collection:** The first step is to collect the data from its source. This can be done manually, or it can be automated using sensors or other devices.
2. **Data cleaning:** Once the data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. This may involve correcting typos, filling in missing values, and removing outliers.
3. **Data transformation:** Once the data has been cleaned, it needs to be transformed into a format that can be used by the computer. This may involve converting the data to a different data type, such as numbers or dates, or it may involve splitting the data into different fields.
4. **Data analysis:** Once the data has been transformed, it can be analyzed using various statistical and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful information.
5. **Data visualization:** The results of the data analysis can be visualized in charts, graphs, and other visual representations to make them easier to understand and interpret.

Data processing is an essential part of many different industries and applications. For example, businesses use data processing to track sales, inventory, and customer behavior. Scientists use data processing to analyze experimental data and develop new theories. Governments use data processing to track crime rates, unemployment, and other social indicators.

Here are some examples of data processing in everyday life:

- When you use a credit card, the data about your purchase is processed to ensure that you have enough credit to make the purchase and to prevent fraud.
- When you search for something on the internet, the search engine processes data about your search query to return relevant results.
- When you use a social media platform, the platform processes data about your activity to recommend friends, content, and ads to you.
- When you use a streaming service to watch a movie or TV show, the service processes data about your viewing habits to recommend other content to you.

Data processing is becoming increasingly important as we generate more and more data. By processing data effectively, we can extract valuable insights that can help us to make better decisions and improve our lives.

# Hardware

Hardware is the physical components of a computer system. It includes all of the electronic and mechanical parts of the computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, input devices, and output devices.

Hardware is responsible for performing all of the basic tasks that a computer needs to do, such as processing data, storing data, and displaying data.

Here is a brief overview of some of the most important hardware components:

- **Central processing unit (CPU):** The CPU is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for processing data and executing instructions.
- **Memory:** Memory stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. There are two main types of memory: random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM).
- **Storage:** Storage devices are used to store data permanently. Common storage devices include hard drives, solid-state drives, and optical discs.
- **Input devices:** Input devices are used to enter data into a computer. Common input devices include the keyboard, mouse, and scanner.
- **Output devices:** Output devices are used to display or print the information that has been processed by the computer. Common output devices include the monitor, printer, and speakers.

Hardware is constantly evolving, and new components and technologies are being developed all the time. However, the basic principles of hardware remain the same.

Here are some examples of hardware:

- Laptops
- Desktop computers
- Smartphones
- Tablets

Hardware is an essential part of any computer system. It provides the physical foundation for all of the software that we use. Without hardware, computers would not be able to function.

# Software

Software is the set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. It is the intangible part of a computer system, in contrast to the physical hardware components.

Software can be divided into two main categories: system software and application software.

**System software** is responsible for the basic functions of a computer system, such as managing hardware resources, providing a platform for running applications, and providing security and other utilities. Common examples of system software include operating systems, device drivers, and firmware.

**Application software** is designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processing, web browsing, and playing games. Common examples of application software include word processors, web browsers, and video games.

Software is essential for all computers, regardless of their size or purpose. Without software, computers would be useless.

Here are some examples of software:

- Operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice Writer)
- Spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
- Presentation software (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, LibreOffice Impress)
- Email clients (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird)
- Photo editing software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, GIMP)
- Video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve)
- Games (e.g., Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, League of Legends)

Software is constantly evolving, and new applications are being developed all the time. Software has revolutionized the way we live and work, and it continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives.

# Firmware

Firmware is a type of software that is embedded in hardware devices to control their functionality. It is typically stored in non-volatile memory, such as ROM or flash memory, so that it is not lost when the device is turned off.

Firmware is responsible for a wide range of tasks, including:

- Booting the device and loading the operating system
- Controlling the hardware components of the device, such as the CPU, memory, and storage
- Providing a low-level interface for the operating system and other software to interact with the hardware

Firmware is essential for the proper operation of all types of hardware devices, from computers and smartphones to microwave ovens and thermostats.

Here are some examples of firmware:

- The BIOS (basic input/output system) in a computer
- The firmware in a smartphone that controls the touchscreen, camera, and other sensors
- The firmware in a microwave oven that controls the cooking process
- The firmware in a thermostat that controls the temperature of a room
