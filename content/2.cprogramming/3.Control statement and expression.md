# Control statement and expression

In C programming, a **control statement** is a statement that controls the flow of execution of a program. Control statements can be used to make decisions, repeat code, or jump to different parts of the program.

An **expression** in C is a sequence of operators and operands that evaluates to a single value. Expressions can be used in control statements to evaluate conditions and determine the flow of execution.

Here are some examples of control statements and expressions in C:

**Control statements:**

- `if` statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
- `else` statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is false.
- `else if` statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true, but only if a previous condition was false.
- `switch` statement: Executes a block of code based on the value of a variable.
- `for` loop: Executes a block of code a fixed number of times.
- `while` loop: Executes a block of code while a condition is true.
- `do...while` loop: Executes a block of code at least once, and then continues to execute it while a condition is true.
- `break` statement: Terminates a loop or switch statement.
- `continue` statement: Skips to the next iteration of a loop.

**Expressions:**

- Arithmetic expressions: Evaluate to a numeric value.
- Relational expressions: Evaluate to a Boolean value (true or false).
- Logical expressions: Evaluate to a Boolean value based on the values of other Boolean expressions.
- Conditional expressions: Evaluate to one of two values based on the value of a Boolean expression.

For example, the following C code shows a simple if statement:

**C**

```c
int main() {
  int age = 18;

  if (age >= 18) {
    printf("You are an adult.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}

```

This code evaluates the condition `age >= 18`. If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces is executed. Otherwise, the code inside the curly braces is skipped.

Here is another example, which shows a simple for loop:

**C**

```c
int main() {
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
  }

  return 0;
}

```

This code executes the block of code inside the curly braces 10 times, with the value of the variable `i` increasing by 1 each time.

Control statements and expressions are essential for writing C programs. By using control statements and expressions, you can control the flow of execution of your programs and make them more efficient and powerful.

## Looping

Looping in C programming is a way to execute a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. There are three types of loops in C:

- **For loop:** A for loop is used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
- **While loop:** A while loop is used to execute a block of code while a condition is true.
- **Do-while loop:** A do-while loop is used to execute a block of code at least once, and then continues to execute it while a condition is true.

**For loop**

The syntax of a for loop is as follows:

**C**

```c
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to be executed
}

```

The `initialization` statement is executed once, before the loop starts. The `condition` statement is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. After the loop body is executed, the `increment` statement is executed. The loop continues to iterate until the `condition` statement evaluates to false.

**Example:**

**C**

```c
int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
  }

  return 0;
}

```

This code will print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.

**While loop**

The syntax of a while loop is as follows:

**C**

```c
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}

```

The `condition` statement is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. After the loop body is executed, the `condition` statement is evaluated again. The loop continues to iterate until the `condition` statement evaluates to false.

**Example:**

**C**

```c
int main() {
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 10) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  }

  return 0;
}

```

This code will print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console, just like the previous example.

**Do-while loop**

The syntax of a do-while loop is as follows:

**C**

```c
do {
  // code to be executed
} while (condition);

```

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the loop body at least once, even if the `condition` statement is false. The `condition` statement is evaluated after the loop body is executed. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed again. The loop continues to iterate until the `condition` statement evaluates to false.

**Example:**

**C**

```c
int main() {
  int i = 0;
  do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  } while (i < 10);

  return 0;
}

```

This code will print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console, just like the previous two examples.

Looping is a powerful tool in C programming. It can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

- Iterating over a collection of data
- Repeating a set of instructions until a certain condition is met
- Counting the number of times a certain event occurs
- Generating a sequence of numbers

By understanding how to use loops, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.

## Array

An array in C is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means that the elements of an array are stored one after the other in memory.

To declare an array in C, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
dataType arrayName[arraySize];

```

For example, the following code declares an array of 10 integers:

**C**

```c
int numbers[10];

```

To access the elements of an array, you use the array index operator (`[]`). The index of an array element starts at 0, and the index of the last element is equal to the array size minus 1.

For example, the following code accesses the first element of the `numbers` array:

**C**

```c
int firstElement = numbers[0];

```

The following code accesses the last element of the `numbers` array:

**C**

```c
int lastElement = numbers[9];

```

You can also use a for loop to iterate over the elements of an array. The following code iterates over the `numbers` array and prints each element to the console:

**C**

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("%d\n", numbers[i]);
}

```

Arrays are a powerful data structure in C. They can be used to store and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently.

Here are some examples of how arrays can be used in C programs:

- **Storing a list of items:** An array can be used to store a list of items, such as the names of students in a class or the prices of products in a store.
- **Implementing a queue or stack:** A queue or stack can be implemented using an array. A queue is a data structure where elements are added to one end and removed from the other end. A stack is a data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.
- **Searching and sorting:** Arrays can be used to implement efficient search and sort algorithms.
- **Processing images and videos:** Arrays can be used to process images and videos. For example, an array can be used to store the pixel values of an image.

Arrays are an essential data structure in C programming. By understanding how to use arrays, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.

# String

A string in C is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`). Strings are typically stored in arrays of characters, but they are not the same as arrays of characters. A string is terminated by a null character, while an array of characters is not.

To declare a string in C, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
char stringName[stringSize];

```

For example, the following code declares a string of 10 characters:

**C**

```c
char myString[10];

```

To initialize a string, you can use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
strcpy(stringName, stringValue);

```

For example, the following code initializes the `myString` variable to the string "Hello, world!"

**C**

```c
strcpy(myString, "Hello, world!");

```

To access the characters of a string, you use the array index operator (`[]`). The index of a string character starts at 0, and the index of the last character is equal to the string size minus 1.

For example, the following code accesses the first character of the `myString` variable:

**C**

```c
char firstCharacter = myString[0];

```

The following code accesses the last character of the `myString` variable:

**C**

```c
char lastCharacter = myString[9];

```

You can also use a for loop to iterate over the characters of a string. The following code iterates over the `myString` variable and prints each character to the console:

**C**

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("%c", myString[i]);
}

```

Strings are a powerful data structure in C. They can be used to store and manipulate text efficiently.

Here are some examples of how strings can be used in C programs:

- **Displaying text on the console:** Strings can be used to display text on the console. For example, the following code displays the string "Hello, world!" to the console:

**C**

```c
printf("Hello, world!");

```

- **Reading user input:** Strings can be used to read user input from the keyboard. For example, the following code reads a string from the keyboard and stores it in the `userInput` variable:

**C**

```c
char userInput[100];
scanf("%s", userInput);

```

- **Processing text files:** Strings can be used to process text files. For example, the following code reads a line from a text file and stores it in the `line` variable:

**C**

```c
char line[100];
fgets(line, 100, myFile);

```

- **Implementing string functions:** Strings can be used to implement string functions, such as `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcat()`. These functions can be used to perform various operations on strings, such as calculating the length of a string, copying a string, and concatenating two strings.

Strings are an essential data structure in C programming. By understanding how to use strings, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.

# Pointers

A pointer in C is a variable that stores the address of another variable. Pointers are used to access and manipulate the data stored in other variables.

To declare a pointer in C, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
dataType *pointerName;

```

For example, the following code declares a pointer to an integer:

**C**

```c
int *pInt;

```

To assign the address of a variable to a pointer, you use the address operator (`&`). For example, the following code assigns the address of the variable `myInt` to the pointer `pInt`:

**C**

```c
int myInt = 10;
pInt = &myInt;

```

Once a pointer is assigned the address of a variable, you can use it to access the data stored in that variable. For example, the following code dereferences the pointer `pInt` to access the value stored in the variable `myInt`:

**C**

```c
int value = *pInt;

```

Pointers can also be used to modify the data stored in other variables. For example, the following code dereferences the pointer `pInt` and modifies the value stored in the variable `myInt`:

**C**

```c
*pInt = 20;

```

Pointers are a powerful tool in C. They can be used to access and manipulate data in memory efficiently. However, pointers can also be dangerous if they are not used correctly. It is important to understand how pointers work before using them in your programs.

Here are some examples of how pointers can be used in C programs:

- **Dynamic memory allocation:** Pointers can be used to allocate memory dynamically at runtime. This allows you to allocate memory for data structures that are not known at compile time.
- **Passing arguments to functions by reference:** Pointers can be used to pass arguments to functions by reference. This allows you to modify the data stored in the caller function from within the callee function.
- **Implementing linked lists and other data structures:** Pointers can be used to implement linked lists and other data structures. This allows you to create data structures that are more efficient and flexible than arrays.

Pointers are an essential tool in C programming. By understanding how to use pointers, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.

Here are some tips for using pointers safely:

- Always check to make sure that a pointer is not null before dereferencing it.
- Avoid using dangling pointers. A dangling pointer is a pointer that points to memory that has been freed.
- Be careful when modifying data through pointers. Make sure that you do not modify data that you do not own.
- Use pointer arithmetic carefully. Pointer arithmetic can be used to access data in memory, but it is important to use it correctly to avoid errors.

If you are new to C programming, I recommend that you learn about pointers before using them in your programs. There are many resources available online and in libraries that can teach you about pointers.

# Structures

A structure in C is a user-defined data type that can be used to group related data items of different types into a single unit. Structures are useful for representing complex data, such as student records, employee records, and product information.

To define a structure in C, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
struct structureName {
  dataType member1;
  dataType member2;
  ...
};

```

For example, the following code defines a structure called `Student` to represent student records:

**C**

```c
struct Student {
  char name[100];
  int age;
  float cgpa;
};

```

To declare a variable of a structure type, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
struct structureName variableName;

```

For example, the following code declares a variable of type `Student` called `student1`:

**C**

```c
struct Student student1;

```

To access the members of a structure variable, you use the dot operator (`.`). For example, the following code accesses the `name` member of the variable `student1`:

**C**

```c
char *studentName = student1.name;

```

You can also use the dot operator to modify the members of a structure variable. For example, the following code modifies the `cgpa` member of the variable `student1`:

**C**

```c
student1.cgpa = 9.0;

```

Structures can also be nested. This means that a structure can contain other structures as members. For example, the following code defines a structure called `Course` to represent course information:

**C**

```c
struct Course {
  char name[100];
  int credits;
};

```

The following code defines a structure called `StudentRecord` to represent student records, including their courses:

**C**

```c
struct StudentRecord {
  struct Student student;
  struct Course courses[5];
};

```

To access the members of a nested structure, you use the dot operator twice. For example, the following code accesses the `name` member of the `Course` structure that is nested within the `StudentRecord` structure:

**C**

```c
char *courseName = studentRecord1.courses[0].name;

```

Structures are a powerful tool in C. They can be used to represent complex data in a clear and concise way. By understanding how to use structures, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.

Here are some examples of how structures can be used in C programs:

- **Storing and manipulating complex data:** Structures can be used to store and manipulate complex data, such as student records, employee records, and product information.
- **Implementing data structures:** Structures can be used to implement data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- **Communicating data between functions:** Structures can be used to communicate data between functions without having to pass multiple arguments to the functions.

Structures are an essential tool in C programming. By understanding how to use structures, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.

# Union

A union in C is a data type that can store different types of data in the same memory location. Unions are useful for saving memory when you need to store different types of data that are not all used at the same time.

To define a union in C, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
union unionName {
  dataType1 member1;
  dataType2 member2;
  ...
};

```

For example, the following code defines a union called `Data` that can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a character array:

**C**

```c
union Data {
  int i;
  float f;
  char str[20];
};

```

To declare a variable of a union type, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```c
union unionName variableName;

```

For example, the following code declares a variable of type `Data` called `data`:

**C**

```c
union Data data;

```

To access the members of a union variable, you use the dot operator (`.`). For example, the following code accesses the `i` member of the variable `data`:

**C**

```c
int value = data.i;

```

However, you can only access one member of a union variable at a time. When you access a member of a union variable, the other members of the union are overwritten.

Unions can be useful in situations where you need to save memory and you do not need to use all of the members of a union variable at the same time. For example, you could use a union to store the state of a game character. The union could store the character's position, health, and inventory. You would only need to access one member of the union at a time, depending on what you are doing in the game.

Here are some examples of how unions can be used in C programs:

- **Saving memory:** Unions can be used to save memory when you need to store different types of data that are not all used at the same time.
- **Implementing data structures:** Unions can be used to implement data structures, such as bit fields and packed data structures.
- **Communicating data between functions:** Unions can be used to communicate data between functions without having to pass multiple arguments to the functions.

Unions are a powerful tool in C programming. By understanding how to use unions, you can write more efficient and powerful C programs.
