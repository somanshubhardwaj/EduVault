# C language

## C Character set

The C character set is a collection of all the valid characters that can be used in C source code. It consists of 256 characters, which are divided into the following categories:

- Alphabets: The upper and lowercase letters of the English alphabet (A-Z, a-z).
- Digits: The 10 digits from 0 to 9.
- Special symbols: A variety of special symbols, such as punctuation marks, mathematical operators, and white space characters.

The following table shows some of the most common characters in the C character set:

| Character | ASCII value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 65 | Uppercase letter A |
| a | 97 | Lowercase letter a |
| 0 | 48 | Digit 0 |
| 9 | 57 | Digit 9 |
| ! | 33 | Exclamation point |
| ? | 63 | Question mark |
| . | 46 | Period |
| , | 44 | Comma |
| ; | 59 | Semicolon |
| {} | 123, 125 | Curly braces |
| [] | 91, 93 | Square brackets |
| () | 40, 41 | Parentheses |

The C character set is used to form all of the elements of a C program, including identifiers, keywords, constants, and operators. For example, the following are all valid C identifiers:

**C**

```c
my_variable
my_function
my_constant

```

The following are all valid C keywords:

**C**

```c
int
float
char
if
else
for

```

The following are all valid C constants:

**C**

```c
10
5.5
'a'
"Hello, world!"

```

The C character set is also used to represent strings in C. A string is a sequence of characters that is enclosed in double quotes ("). For example, the following is a valid C string:

**C**

```c
"Hello, world!"

```

The C character set is a fundamental part of the C programming language. It is used to form all of the elements of a C program, including identifiers, keywords, constants, operators, and strings.

## Literals

A literal in C is a representation of a fixed value. Literals can be of any of the following types:

- Integer literals
- Floating-point literals
- Character literals
- String literals

**Integer literals** can be written in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation. Decimal literals are the most common and are written simply as a sequence of digits. Octal literals begin with a leading zero and use the digits 0 to 7. Hexadecimal literals begin with a leading 0x or 0X and use the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A to F.

**Floating-point literals** represent numbers with a fractional part. They are written as a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal point, and then optionally followed by a scientific notation exponent.

**Character literals** represent individual characters. They are written as a single character enclosed in single quotes (').

**String literals** represent sequences of characters. They are written as a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (").

Here are some examples of literals in C:

**C**

```c
// Integer literals
int a = 10; // Decimal literal
int b = 012; // Octal literal
int c = 0xA; // Hexadecimal literal

// Floating-point literals
float d = 3.14159;
double e = 1.2345678901234567e-16;

// Character literals
char f = 'a';
char g = '\n'; // Newline character

// String literals
char *s = "Hello, world!";

```

Literals are used in C programs to initialize variables, assign values to expressions, and pass arguments to functions. They are an essential part of the C programming language.

## keywords

Keywords in C are reserved words that have special meaning to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, or other types.

There are 32 keywords in C:

auto, break, case, char, const, continue, default, do, double, else, enum, extern, float, for, goto, if, inline, int, long, register, restrict, return, short, signed, sizeof, static, struct, switch, typedef, union, unsigned, void, volatile, while

Keywords are used in C programs to declare variables, define functions, control the flow of execution, and perform other tasks. For example, the `int` keyword is used to declare an integer variable, the `if` keyword is used to control the flow of execution, and the `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function.

Here are some examples of keywords in C:

**C**

```c
// Declare an integer variable
int my_variable;

// Define a function
int add_two_numbers(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Control the flow of execution
if (my_variable > 10) {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else
}

// Return a value from a function
int main() {
  int result = add_two_numbers(1, 2);
  return result;
}

```

Keywords are an essential part of the C programming language. They are used to control the flow of execution, perform various tasks, and make code more readable.

## Identifiers

Identifiers in C are names that are given to variables, functions, types, and other entities in a C program. They are used to uniquely identify these entities so that the compiler can keep track of them.

Identifiers can be composed of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_). The first character of an identifier must be either a letter or an underscore. Identifiers cannot contain spaces or special symbols other than the underscore.

Here are some examples of valid C identifiers:

**C**

```c
my_variable
my_function
my_type

```

Here are some examples of invalid C identifiers:

**C**

```c
1my_variable // The first character must be a letter or an underscore.
my variable // Spaces are not allowed.
my-function // Special symbols other than the underscore are not allowed.

```

Identifiers are an essential part of the C programming language. They allow programmers to give meaningful names to their variables, functions, types, and other entities, which makes code more readable and maintainable.

Here are some tips for choosing good identifiers:

- Make them descriptive of the entity they represent.
- Avoid using keywords.
- Avoid using abbreviations unless they are well-known and widely used.
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout your code.

By following these tips, you can choose identifiers that will make your code more readable and maintainable.

## Data types and size

The following table shows the data types and their sizes in C:

| Data type | Size (bytes) |
|---|---|---|
| char | 1 |
| short int | 2 |
| int | 4 |
| long int | 4 or 8 |
| unsigned int | 4 or 8 |
| float | 4 |
| double | 8 |
| long double | 8 or 16 |

The actual size of a data type can vary depending on the compiler and the target platform. However, the C standard guarantees that the following relationships between the data types hold:

- char <= short int <= int <= long int
- char <= unsigned short int <= unsigned int <= unsigned long int
- float <= double <= long double

The size of a data type is important because it determines how much memory is allocated to store a variable of that type. It also affects the range of values that a variable can store and the performance of certain operations.

For example, a char variable can store a single character, which is typically represented by a single byte. An int variable can store a much larger range of values, such as integers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. However, this also means that an int variable requires more memory to store.

When choosing a data type for a variable, it is important to consider the following factors:

- The range of values that the variable needs to store
- The performance requirements of the program
- The memory constraints of the target platform

By carefully choosing the data types for your variables, you can improve the performance and efficiency of your C programs.

## Variable declaration

Variable declaration in C is the process of telling the compiler about the existence of a variable and its data type. This is done using the following syntax:

**C**

```c
data_type variable_name;

```

where `data_type` is the type of data that the variable will store and `variable_name` is the name of the variable.

For example, the following declaration declares a variable named `my_variable` of type `int`:

**C**

```c
int my_variable;

```

This tells the compiler that `my_variable` is an integer variable and that it should allocate enough memory to store an integer value.

Variables can be declared anywhere in a C program, but it is generally considered good practice to declare them at the beginning of the block of code in which they will be used. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Here are some additional rules for variable declaration in C:

- Variable names must be unique within the same scope.
- Variable names cannot start with a number.
- Variable names cannot contain special characters other than the underscore (_).
- Variable declarations must end with a semicolon (;).

Here is an example of a complete C program with a variable declaration:

**C**

```c
#include <stdio.h>int main() {
  int my_variable;

  my_variable = 10;

  printf("my_variable = %d\n", my_variable);

  return 0;
}

```

Output:

`my_variable = 10`

Variable declaration is an important part of the C programming language. It is essential to declare all variables before using them in your code.

## Expression

An expression in C is a combination of operands and operators that evaluates to a value. Operands can be variables, constants, literals, or function calls. Operators can be arithmetic, relational, logical, or assignment operators.

Expressions are used in C to perform calculations, compare values, and control the flow of execution. For example, the following expression evaluates to the sum of the two variables `a` and `b`:

**C**

```
a + b

```

The following expression evaluates to `true` if the variable `a` is greater than the variable `b`:

**C**

```
a > b

```

The following expression assigns the value of the variable `a` to the variable `c`:

**C**

```
c = a

```

Expressions can be nested together to form more complex expressions. For example, the following expression evaluates to the product of the sum of the variables `a` and `b` and the variable `c`:

**C**

```
(a + b) * c

```

Expressions are an essential part of the C programming language. They are used to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as calculations, comparisons, and controlling the flow of execution.

Here are some examples of valid C expressions:

**C**

```
// Arithmetic expressions
a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b

// Relational expressions
a > b
a < b
a >= b
a <= b
a == b
a != b

// Logical expressions
a && b
a || b
!a

// Assignment expressions
a = b
c = a + b

```

Expressions can be used in C statements, such as the following:

**C**

```
// Print the value of the variable `a` to the console.
printf("a = %d\n", a);

// If the variable `a` is greater than the variable `b`, then print the message "a is greater than b".
if (a > b) {
  printf("a is greater than b\n");
}

// Assign the value of the variable `a` to the variable `c`.
c = a;

```

By understanding how to use expressions, you can write C programs to perform a wide variety of tasks.

# Labels

A label in C is a name that can be used to identify a statement in a program. Labels are used in conjunction with the `goto` statement to transfer control of the program to the labeled statement.

To declare a label in C, you use the following syntax:

**C**

```
label_name:

```

where `label_name` is the name of the label.

Once a label has been declared, you can use the `goto` statement to transfer control of the program to the labeled statement. The `goto` statement takes the following syntax:

**C**

```
goto label_name;

```

where `label_name` is the name of the label that you want to transfer control to.

Labels can be used to implement a variety of control flow patterns, such as loops and nested loops. However, it is important to use labels carefully, as they can make code difficult to read and maintain.

Here is an example of a C program that uses a label:

**C**

```
#include <stdio.h>int main() {
  int i;

loop:
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
  }

  // Transfer control back to the beginning of the loop.
  goto loop;

  return 0;
}

```

Output:

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...`

As you can see, the `goto` statement is used to transfer control back to the beginning of the loop. This causes the loop to execute indefinitely.

Labels can be a useful tool for implementing complex control flow patterns. However, it is important to use them carefully, as they can make code difficult to read and maintain.

# Statements

A statement in C is a complete instruction that tells the compiler what to do. Statements can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

- Declaring and initializing variables
- Performing calculations
- Comparing values
- Controlling the flow of execution
- Calling functions

Statements are grouped together to form blocks of code. Blocks of code can be enclosed in curly braces ({ }). For example, the following code shows a block of code that contains two statements:

**C**

```
{
  int a = 10;
  printf("%d\n", a);
}

```

The first statement in the block of code declares and initializes a variable named `a`. The second statement prints the value of the variable `a` to the console.

Statements can also be executed conditionally, using the `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements. For example, the following code shows a conditional statement:

**C**

```
if (a > 10) {
  printf("a is greater than 10\n");
}

```

This statement will only execute if the value of the variable `a` is greater than 10.

Statements can also be executed repeatedly, using the `while`, `do...while`, and `for` loops. For example, the following code shows a while loop:

**C**

```
while (a < 10) {
  printf("%d\n", a);
  a++;
}

```

This loop will execute repeatedly until the value of the variable `a` is equal to 10.

Statements are an essential part of the C programming language. By understanding how to use statements, you can write C programs to perform a wide variety of tasks.

Here are some other examples of C statements:

- `break`: Used to exit a loop or switch statement
- `continue`: Used to skip to the next iteration of a loop
- `return`: Used to return from a function
- `switch`: Used to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable
- `goto`: Used to transfer control of the program to a labeled statement

Statements can be combined to form more complex statements. For example, the following code shows a compound statement:

**C**

```
if (a > 10) {
  printf("a is greater than 10\n");
} else {
  printf("a is less than or equal to 10\n");
}

```

This statement is a compound statement because it contains two statements: an `if` statement and an `else` statement.

Statements are a fundamental part of the C programming language. By understanding how to use statements, you can write C programs to perform a wide variety of tasks.

# F**ormatted input output statement**

Formatted input/output (I/O) statements in C are used to read and write data in a specific format. The two most common formatted I/O statements are `printf()` and `scanf()`.

The `printf()` statement is used to print data to the console. It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments as input. The format string specifies how the data should be formatted and printed. The variable number of arguments are the data values that are to be printed.

The following is an example of the `printf()` statement:

**C**

```
printf("Hello, world!\n");

```

This statement will print the string "Hello, world!" to the console.

The `scanf()` statement is used to read data from the console. It takes a format string and a variable number of pointers to variables as input. The format string specifies the format of the data that is to be read. The variable number of pointers to variables are the variables where the read data is to be stored.

The following is an example of the `scanf()` statement:

**C**

```
int a;
scanf("%d", &a);

```

This statement will read an integer value from the console and store it in the variable `a`.

Formatted I/O statements are a powerful tool for reading and writing data in a specific format. They are essential for writing any C program that interacts with the user.

Here are some other examples of formatted I/O statements in C:

**C**

```
// Print a floating-point number to the console with two decimal places of precision.
printf("%.2f\n", 3.14159);

// Read a string from the console and store it in the variable `name`.
char name[100];
scanf("%s", name);

// Read a single character from the console and store it in the variable `c`.
char c;
scanf("%c", &c);

```

Formatted I/O statements are a versatile tool that can be used to read and write a variety of data types in a specific format. They are an essential part of the C programming language.

# Types of operator

There are six main types of operators in C:

- Arithmetic operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators
- Assignment operators
- Miscellaneous operators

**Arithmetic operators** are used to perform basic arithmetic operations on operands, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The following table shows the arithmetic operators in C:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|---|
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| % | Modulus (remainder) |
| ++ | Increment |
| -- | Decrement |

**Relational operators** are used to compare two operands and return a Boolean value (true or false). The following table shows the relational operators in C:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|---|
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |
| < | Less than |
| > | Greater than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |

**Logical operators** are used to combine two Boolean values and return a single Boolean value. The following table shows the logical operators in C:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|---|
| && | Logical AND |
| || | Logical OR |
| ! | Logical NOT |

**Bitwise operators** are used to perform bit-level operations on operands. The following table shows the bitwise operators in C:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|---|
| & | Bitwise AND |
| | | Bitwise OR |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR |
| ~ | Bitwise NOT |
| >> | Right shift |
| << | Left shift |

**Assignment operators** are used to assign values to variables. The following table shows the assignment operators in C:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|---|
| = | Simple assignment |
| += | Addition assignment |
| -= | Subtraction assignment |
| *= | Multiplication assignment |
| /= | Division assignment |
| %= | Modulus assignment |
| &= | Bitwise AND assignment |
| |= | Bitwise OR assignment |
| ^= | Bitwise XOR assignment |
| >>= | Right shift assignment |
| <<= | Left shift assignment |

**Miscellaneous operators** are a group of operators that do not fit neatly into any of the other categories. The following table shows some of the miscellaneous operators in C:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|---|
| & | Address-of operator |
| * | Dereference operator |
| sizeof | Sizeof operator |
| , | Comma operator |
| ?: | Conditional operator |

Operators are an essential part of the C programming language. They allow us to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, logical operations, and bit-level operations. By understanding how to use operators, we can write C programs to perform a wide variety of tasks.

# Data type of conversion

Data type conversion in C is the process of changing the data type of a variable or expression. This can be done either implicitly or explicitly.

**Implicit data type conversion** is performed by the compiler automatically. It occurs when the compiler encounters an expression where the operands have different data types. The compiler will automatically promote the operand with the lower data type to the data type of the other operand.

**Explicit data type conversion** is performed by the programmer using a cast operator. This is necessary when the compiler cannot perform implicit data type conversion or when the programmer wants to force the compiler to convert a value to a specific data type.

The following table shows some of the common data type conversions in C:

| Conversion | Example |
|---|---|---|
| int to float | int a = 10; float b = (float) a; |
| float to int | float a = 3.14159; int b = (int) a; |
| char to int | char a = 'A'; int b = (int) a; |
| int to char | int a = 65; char b = (char) a; |

It is important to note that data type conversion can result in data loss or unexpected behavior. For example, if we convert a floating-point number to an integer, the fractional part of the number will be lost. Additionally, if we convert a character to an integer, the integer value of the character will be returned.

Here are some tips for using data type conversion safely:

- Only perform data type conversion when necessary.
- Be aware of the potential for data loss or unexpected behavior.
- Use cast operators to explicitly convert values to specific data types.

Data type conversion is a powerful tool that can be used to manipulate data in a variety of ways. However, it is important to use it carefully to avoid data loss or unexpected behavior.

---

**Mixed-mode arithmetic** in C is the process of performing arithmetic operations on operands of different data types. This can be done either implicitly or explicitly.

**Implicit mixed-mode arithmetic** is performed by the compiler automatically. It occurs when the compiler encounters an expression where the operands have different data types. The compiler will automatically promote the operand with the lower data type to the data type of the other operand.

**Explicit mixed-mode arithmetic** is performed by the programmer using a cast operator. This is necessary when the compiler cannot perform implicit mixed-mode arithmetic or when the programmer wants to force the compiler to perform an arithmetic operation on operands of different data types.

When performing mixed-mode arithmetic, it is important to note that the result of the operation will be of the data type of the operand with the higher data type. Additionally, the compiler may perform rounding or truncation when converting the operands to the same data type.

Here are some examples of mixed-mode arithmetic in C:

**C**

```
// Implicit mixed-mode arithmetic
int a = 10;
float b = 3.14159;
float c = a + b; // c will be of type float

// Explicit mixed-mode arithmetic
char d = 'A';
int e = (int) d; // e will be of type int

```

It is important to use mixed-mode arithmetic carefully, as it can lead to unexpected results. For example, if we divide an integer by a floating-point number, the result may be rounded or truncated. Additionally, if we add a character to an integer, the character will be converted to its ASCII value before the addition is performed.

Here are some tips for using mixed-mode arithmetic safely:

- Be aware of the potential for unexpected results.
- Use cast operators to explicitly convert operands to the desired data type.
- Avoid performing arithmetic operations on operands of different data types if possible.

Mixed-mode arithmetic can be a useful tool, but it is important to use it carefully to avoid unexpected results.

# Control structures

Control structures in C are statements that allow programmers to control the flow of execution of a program. They are used to make decisions, repeat tasks, and jump to different parts of the code.

There are three main types of control structures in C:

- **Selection statements:** These statements allow programmers to make decisions based on the value of a variable or expression. The most common selection statements are the `if` statement and the `switch` statement.
- **Iteration statements:** These statements allow programmers to repeat tasks until a certain condition is met. The most common iteration statements are the `while` loop, the `do...while` loop, and the `for` loop.
- **Jump statements:** These statements allow programmers to transfer control of the program to a different part of the code. The most common jump statement is the `goto` statement.

Here are some examples of control structures in C:

**C**

```
// Selection statement
if (a > 10) {
  // Do something if a is greater than 10
} else {
  // Do something if a is less than or equal to 10
}

// Iteration statement
while (a < 10) {
  // Do something while a is less than 10
  a++;
}

// Jump statement
goto label; // Transfer control to the labeled statement

```

Control structures are an essential part of the C programming language. They allow programmers to write code that is more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

Here are some tips for using control structures effectively:

- Use the appropriate control structure for the task at hand.
- Avoid using nested control structures if possible.
- Use comments to explain what your control structures are doing.
- Test your code thoroughly to make sure that the control structures are working as expected.

By following these tips, you can use control structures to write more efficient, readable, and maintainable C code.
